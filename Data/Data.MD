Due to the size of the data, and for ease of accessing through Google Colab, I have posted it under my kaggle account [here](https://www.kaggle.com/harperd17/mushroom-pictures-sorted). The zipped data file is ~55 MB.
The original data set is from [a github user](https://github.com/bechtle/mushroomobser-dataset). The author has written code to scrape images from [mushroom observer](https://mushroomobserver.org/), which contains user contributed images of mushrooms by species. I used images previously scraped by the author for this project found on a [dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/m1o91dwd1nto6w0/AADACdc0WF_oIAyKN5W1UvDta/images_files/complete_dataset/TRAIN_2006-2015?dl=0&subfolder_nav_tracking=1) from user contributions between 2006 and 2015.
